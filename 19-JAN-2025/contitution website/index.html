                                <h2>Unit 1: Constitution Law</h2>
                                <p>Constitution law is a body of law which defines the role, powers, and structure of different entities within a state, namely, the executive, the parliament or legislature, and the judiciary; as well as the basic rights of citizens and, in federal countries such as the United States and Canada, the relationship between the central government and state, provincial, or territorial governments.</p>
                                <p>Not all nation states have codified constitutions, though all such states have a jus commune, or law of the land, that may consist of a variety of imperative and consensual rules. These may include customary law, conventions, statutory law, judge-made law, or international rules and norms. Constitutional law deals with the fundamental principles by which the government exercises its authority.</p>
                                <p>In some instances, these principles grant specific powers to the government, such as the power to tax and spend for the welfare of the population. Other times, constitutional principles act to place limits on what the government can do, such as prohibiting the arrest of an individual without sufficient cause.</p>
                                <p>In most nations, such as the United States, India, and Singapore, constitutional law is based on the text of a document ratified at the time the nation came into being. Other constitutions, notably that of the United Kingdom, rely heavily on unwritten rules known as constitutional conventions; their status within constitutional law varies, and the terms of conventions are in some cases strongly contested.</p>

                            <article id="constitutionalism">
                                <h2>What is Constitutionalism?</h2>
                                <p>The concept of constitutionalism is a mechanism that provides legitimacy to a democratic government. It cannot and should not be confused with the legality of the acts of the officials in a government setup. Constitutionalism is far more important than having a written Constitution.</p>
                                <p>With some exceptions, most countries have Constitutions, but it in no way means that they practice constitutionalism. Some of the basic principles developed over time that embody the concept of constitutionalism are separation of powers, judicial control, and accountable government.</p>

                            <!-- Principles of Constitutionalism -->
                            <article id="principles">
                                <h2>Principles of Constitutionalism</h2>
                                <p>Constitutionalism is an amalgamation of the following underlying principles:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Separation of Powers:</strong> Separation of powers divides the mechanism of governance into three branches: Legislature, Executive, and Judiciary. This prevents the monopolization of power and creates a system of checks and balances.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Responsible and Accountable Government:</strong> In a democratic setup, the government is elected to serve the people. The electors have a right to demand accountability and answers from their government. If the government fails to meet expectations, the authority to govern is revoked through elections.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Popular Sovereignty:</strong> The government derives its legitimacy from the people. Ultimate sovereignty resides in the nation, and the power of the government emanates from the public.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Rule of Law:</strong> The presence of rule of law ensures that the government operates within the law, protecting individual rights and freedoms. According to Dicey, there are three essential components of the rule of law:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Nobody is punished except for a specific breach of law that is established in an ordinary legal manner before ordinary courts of law.</li>
                                            <li>No one is above the law.</li>
                                            <li>Courts play a vital role in protecting the rights and freedoms of individuals.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Independent Judiciary:</strong> The independence of the Judiciary is essential for upholding the rule of law. It acts as the protector of the Constitution and individual rights. The Constitution separates the Judiciary from the Executive under Article 50.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Individual Rights:</strong> The rights of individuals must be at the highest pedestal for constitutionalism to thrive. In India, these rights are enshrined in Part III of the Constitution and are protected and interpreted by the courts, ensuring their enforcement.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h2>Additional Principles of Constitutionalism</h2>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Civilian Control of the Military:</strong> Apart from the traditional features of constitutionalism, it also envisages that the control of the military should be in the hands of a civilian government. This prevents the military from interfering in the democratic decision-making process or attempting a military coup.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Police Accountability:</strong> Constitutionalism also emphasizes the accountability of the police. While performing their duties, police forces must uphold the rights, freedoms, and dignity of individuals. This is ensured by bringing the police under the control of laws and the judiciary.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h2>Historical Perspective of the Indian Constitution</h2>
                                <p>The history of the Constitution of India is very insightful as it explains exactly how it came into being. It also explains why India chose the Parliamentary form of democracy in its modern form.</p>
                                <p>The British came to India in the 17th century initially for trading only. Eventually, after slowly gaining more power, they attained the rights to collect revenue and govern themselves. In order to do this, they enacted various laws, rules, and regulations.</p>
                                <p>According to the Charter Act of 1833, the Governor General of Bengal became the Governor General of India. It also created a Central Legislature, which, in a way, made the British supreme rulers of India.</p>
                                <p>The rule of the Company itself finally ended with the Government of India Act in 1858. As a result, the British Crown became the ruler of India and administered the country through its government.</p>
                                <p>The Indian Councils Acts of 1861, 1892, and 1909 started giving representation to Indians in the Viceroy’s councils. They also restored legislative powers back to some provinces. In other words, they adopted decentralization of powers between the Centre and the provinces.</p>
